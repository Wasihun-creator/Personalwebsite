	<div id="about">

				<big>

		I am Wasiun Dangura. I was born in Jan 1st of 1999 G.C at a small town
		near  Hawassa, the capital  of South Nations, and Nationalities (SNNP), 
		from my father Dangura Tontone, and Edilnesh Hailu. I'm the last child 
		of the  family. This  in turn helped  me to grow by gathering a lot of 
		experience  from my  older brothers, and sisters. It also  directed my 
		parents focus to be up on me.


		After  my mother  was passed  away, at my 3rd, taking  care for me and
		immediate  older brothers  was left to  our sisters and elder brothers. 
		Then  we were  moved to  Hawassa hoping  for a better  education there
		,at my 7th, where I continued a better schooling.


		I'm good at  social life, that's why most of my academic background is
		full of group works and helping each other. I believe on the qoute "If
		you  wanna go fast, go alone. But if you wanna  go farther go together
		." I'm also good at helping my families and household activities, like
		cooking, baking, cleaning  the house, nursing  babies... I'm also nice
		on my community life like  negotiating, counseling, obedience,... This
		in turn build a good  profile to me among the community even though it
		was not my motive for doing so.


		I believe that everything is possible and any situation can be changed.
		I believe on God  almighty that's why I believe on possiblity. Current
		situation, and reality  may be a direct opposite of what I believe and
		hope for, but it  will be changed. Actually, reality  is almost always 
		against the vision of someone. Here is a saying, "A rever cuts through
		a rock  not because of its  strength, but because of its persistance."


		Leading a nation from darkness to ligth, bondage to freedom, astray to
		their destiny, which is their path, ... is what I am living for. I am 
		also one among those who believe in visitation of Ethiopia. 

		Right now, I'm just preparing myself for my destiny, the purpose for 
		which I'm living and determined to die.

	My schooling traces its background to Bensa where I joined local
	school. I moved  to Hawassa where I  continued my education with 
	more and better opportunity.  
	

	I learned at Rehobot Kindergarten, until my 3rd, then I attended 
	my  remaining class, until my 10th, at Hayole  Education project. 
	My schooling summed up at Debub Ethiopia Academy.
	

	I was committed to my study since the very beginning of my class,
	this may be  because of the influence of my brothers and sisters. 
	I  was a rank  student, meaning  from KG to  12, I  had a lot of 
	certificates and rewards.


	I  participated in  different  school  clubs, like  theatre  and
	literature, sport...and also I served as school president, civic
	ambassador, team orginizer and motivator...   


	I also participate in christian student fellowships, it's a group
	of students who worship God together. I had an amazing time in it, 
	specially during my stay  at Debub Ethiopia Academy (11th & 12th). 
	There God helped us a lot. He transformed us, changed our toughts,
	insights, and  revealed us our visions. I  discovered my personal 
	destiny  there by the help of  God. I saw  true love,  friendship, 
	fellowship...there. Thanks to the LORD.

	At school, we  spent unforgottable time. We were happy, unified, 
	helping each other, ... Everybody contributed for such thing to
	come unto us.   
	

	When I was  school president, I tried to equip students with not
	only discpline, even though  this was the major issue during the
	time to school  adminstratives, but also facilitating team study
	to support those who  need academic  help and to enhance insight
	of high achievers. 


	After graduated from Debub  Ethiopia Academy, grade 12, I joined
	Addis Ababa UNiversity, Amist Kilo Campus, Addis Ababa Institute
	of  Technology. Now, I am a  second  year  Software  Engineering 
	student.
