						Vectors are created to carry  pathogens, themselves  causing  no

						something and to move the nation to thier destiny.
						


						"Lion  is not the  tallest, largest, heaviest, biggest, and most 
						intellegent  animal in the  jungle, yet he's king  over  all the 
						animals. What  makes him king?  It's it the way he  sees himself
						and the  world. You don't need to be  big, smart, or intellegent,
						tall, heavy  or have  something  else  to  influence the world."
						 						<i>Dr.Myles Munroe</i>.


						It is the  way you see  yourself, and the world  that  makes you
						either  king , slave  or simple. Having  good  sight  by  itself 
						cannot make you influential, but  how do you see, is it with eye
						glass or bare eye? The type  of glass affects the appreanance of 
						things. 


						In advance, you  can use microscope, and telescope to see what is 
						invisible  for  humaneyes  so, how  and  through  what  you   see 
						determines your influence.

		I am Wasiun Dangura. I was born in Jan 1st of 1999 G.C at a small town
		near  Hawassa, the capital  of South Nations, and Nationalities (SNNP), 
		from my father Dangura Tontone, and Edilnesh Hailu. I'm the last child 
		of the  family. This  in turn helped  me to grow by gathering a lot of 
		experience  from my  older brothers, and sisters. It also  directed my 
		parents focus to be up on me.


		After  my mother  was passed  away, at my 3rd, taking  care for me and
		immediate  older brothers  was left to  our sisters and elder brothers. 
		Then  we were  moved to  Hawassa hoping  for a better  education there
		,at my 7th, where I continued a better schooling.


		I'm good at  social life, that's why most of my academic background is
		full of group works and helping each other. I believe on the qoute "If
		you  wanna go fast, go alone. But if you wanna  go farther go together
		." I'm also good at helping my families and household activities, like
		cooking, baking, cleaning  the house, nursing  babies... I'm also nice
		on my community life like  negotiating, counseling, obedience,... This
		in turn build a good  profile to me among the community even though it
		was not my motive for doing so.


		I believe that everything is possible and any situation can be changed.
		I believe on God  almighty that's why I believe on possiblity. Current
		situation, and reality  may be a direct opposite of what I believe and
		hope for, but it  will be changed. Actually, reality  is almost always 
		against the vision of someone. Here is a saying, "A rever cuts through
		a rock  not because of its  strength, but because of its persistance."


		Leading a nation from darkness to ligth, bondage to freedom, astray to
		their destiny, which is their path, ... is what I am living for. I am 
		also one among those who believe in visitation of Ethiopia. 

		Right now, I'm just preparing myself for my destiny, the purpose for 
		which I'm living and determined to die.
